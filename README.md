Shell and generic mapping tools script for plotting earthquakes from global CMT data along depth across a specified transect.

Input data is the GCMT catalogue PSMeca and PSVelomeca files from harvard CMT catalogue.

The Python file 2DFocalMechanism.py separates fault and nodal plane into strike dip and rake for stress inversions.

The stress inversion is done using MSATSI.

JPEG files are the final results.
